          I'm Diego, a professional musician with over a decade's experience as a session bass player. Now, I'm embarking on a new journey - exploring the world of coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began when I was just 14, creating simple websites on topics close to my heart, like football, the NBA, and music. Back then, HTML was quite different, and I relied on Dreamweaver for my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, at 35, I'm excited to blend the familiar with the uncharted. Coding is my newfound fascination, and I'm determined to make the most of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I initially tried to join UK government-backed bootcamps but quickly realized I had no prior coding knowledge. With determination, I embarked on self-learning using resources like YouTube, FreeCodeCamp, and Scrimba. Gradually, I began to grasp the intricacies of coding, and it no longer felt unfamiliar.
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered Founders and Coders (FAC), renowned as one of the top programs in the UK. Although I had attempted to join FAC in the past, my knowledge was not yet sufficient. I'm still on my learning journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attending FAC meetings, I found myself welcomed in an environment filled with people ready to learn and help. It became clear that FAC is where I want to be to continue my learning journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I move forward, I'm enthusiastic about embracing the vast opportunities in web development. Coding represents the perfect blend of creativity and problem-solving, and I'm determined to make a meaningful contribution in this dynamic field, all while aspiring to combine my passion for music with programming in the future.
